# Shared API reference

The helpers a command in this repo can call. They come from
`github.com/neetozone/neeto-cli-commons` and behave identically in all eleven neeto CLIs.

This file is generated. Edit it in neeto-cli-commons, not here.

## Talking to the API

`getClient(cmd)` returns a client already pointed at the right host and carrying the caller's
credentials, so a command never builds a URL or reads a token itself.

| Call | Sends |
|---|---|
| `c.Get(path, params)` | `GET`, with `params` as the query string. Pass `nil` for none. |
| `c.Post(path, body)` | `POST` with a JSON body. |
| `c.Put(path, body)` | `PUT` with a JSON body. This is the usual update verb. |
| `c.Patch(path, body)` | `PATCH` with a JSON body, for endpoints that expect a partial update. |
| `c.Delete(path)` | `DELETE`. |

`path` is relative to `/api/external/v2`. Every call returns the raw response body, so a command
passes it straight to a printer rather than unmarshalling it.

An error carries the server's own message, so returning it from `RunE` prints something useful
without any handling in the command.

## Printing

Pick by shape, never by output format — one printer covers the table, `--json`, `--quiet` and
`--toon`.

| Call | Use for |
|---|---|
| `printList(data, key, breadcrumbs)` | A collection. `key` names the array inside the body. Pagination is picked up automatically. |
| `printResource(data, breadcrumbs)` | One record. |
| `printActionResult(data, breadcrumbs)` | A create, update or other action. Under `--quiet` it prints just the identifier. |
| `printMessage(text)` | A confirmation with no record behind it. |

Breadcrumbs are the "what to run next" hints printed under a record:

```go
[]output.Breadcrumb{
	{Label: "List widgets", Command: "neetorecord widgets list"},
}
```

Columns are chosen from `priority_fields` in `.neeto-cli.yml`, identity first, up to seven
columns. Add a field there rather than building a table by hand.

## Paging

`addPaginationFlags(cmd)` adds `--page` and `--page-size`; `paginationParams(cmd)` turns them into
query parameters. `--page` defaults to 0, meaning the first page, in every product.

## Flags

| Call | Effect |
|---|---|
| `markFlagsRequired(cmd, "name", ...)` | Fails early when a flag is missing, and marks it in help. |
| `allowJSONFileToSatisfyRequiredFlags(cmd)` | Lets `--json-file` stand in for the required flags. |
| `readJSONFile(path)` | Reads a `--json-file` payload. |
| `splitCSV(value)` | Splits a comma-separated flag value. |

Keep only the wrappers this repo actually uses in `internal/commands/register.go`.

## Global flags

`--subdomain`, `--json`, `--quiet` and `--toon` are added to every command by the shared code. A
command never declares them and never checks them; using the printers above is what makes them
work.
