# Adding a command

Everything generic — authentication, the HTTP client, table and JSON rendering, `doctor`,
`completion`, `setup`, `update`, `version` and `commands` — comes from
`github.com/neetozone/neeto-cli-commons`. This repo holds only NeetoRecord's own commands.

This file is generated. Edit it in neeto-cli-commons, not here.

## Where things live

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `.neeto-cli.yml` | This product's identity: names, API base path, table column priority. |
| `product.go` | Embeds `.neeto-cli.yml` and the skill so the binary carries both. |
| `cmd/neetorecord/main.go` | Builds the app and hands it this repo's commands. |
| `internal/commands/register.go` | Thin wrappers over the shared app. |
| `internal/commands/*.go` | One file per resource. This is where you work. |
| `skills/neetorecord/SKILL.md` | What an AI assistant is told this CLI can do. |

Every other file in the repo is written by `neeto-cli-sync` and asserted in CI. Editing one by
hand fails the build.

## Write the command

Copy the nearest existing resource file and change the parts that differ. A file registers itself,
so nothing else needs editing:

```go
var widgetsCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "widgets",
	Short: "Manage widgets",
}

var widgetsListCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "list",
	Short: "List widgets",
	RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
		c, err := getClient(cmd)
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}

		data, err := c.Get("/widgets", paginationParams(cmd))
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}

		printList(data, "widgets", nil)
		return nil
	},
}

func init() {
	register(func(root *cobra.Command) { root.AddCommand(widgetsCmd) })

	widgetsCmd.AddCommand(widgetsListCmd)
	addPaginationFlags(widgetsListCmd)
}
```

`register` collects the closure; `Register` replays them all onto the shared root command once
`main` has built the app.

## House conventions

These are what keep the eleven neeto CLIs looking like one product. Follow them.

- A list command is `list`, a single record is `show`, never `get`.
- `Short` reads `List widgets`, not `List all widgets`, and is written for a customer — it becomes
  the description published on the docs site.
- A confirmation reads `Widget deleted.`, never `Widget deleted successfully.`
- Never call `fmt.Print` in a command. Use `printList`, `printResource`, `printActionResult` or
  `printMessage`, or `--json`, `--quiet` and `--toon` will not work.
- Mark a required flag with `markFlagsRequired`. Do not write `(required)` into the flag's
  description — it is added when help is rendered and left out of the machine-readable catalog.
- A flag that reads a payload from a file is `--json-file`.
- Split a comma-separated flag with `splitCSV`, never `strings.Split` — it trims the spaces a
  user naturally types after each comma.
- `register.go` should carry only the wrappers this repo actually calls.

## Testing a command

`getClient`, `printList`, `printResource`, `printActionResult` and `printMessage` all read a
package-level app that `main` sets up, so a test calling one of them directly panics unless the
package is bootstrapped first. Do that once per package, in `internal/commands/main_test.go`:

```go
func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
	cfg, err := config.Parse(product.ConfigYAML)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	Register(cli.New(*cfg))
	os.Exit(m.Run())
}
```

`paginationParams` and `addPaginationFlags` need no bootstrap.

## Before you push

```bash
make build
./neetorecord widgets list
./neetorecord widgets list --json
./neetorecord widgets list --quiet
gofmt -l . && go vet ./... && go test ./...
```

`neetorecord commands` prints the full command surface as JSON. The docs site is generated
from it, so check your new command appears there and reads well.

Update `skills/neetorecord/SKILL.md` in the same change. An assistant reads that file to
decide what NeetoRecord can do, and a stale one makes it answer wrongly.
